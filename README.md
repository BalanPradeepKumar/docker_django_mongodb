# docker_django_mongodb
Dockerize Django-MongoDB Application with docker-compose 

## Introduction

A Quick Start Example to run Django-MongoDB Application in Docker.

## Requirements

This module requires the following modules/libraries:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* Any version of Linux or Unix OS (Recommended and Optional)

## Installation

Install using the following the command,

```docker-compose up -d --build```

## What does this example teach us?

### Initializing a fresh instance with MongoDB dump data

When a container is started for the first time, it will execute files with extensions `.sh`, and `.js` that are found in `init_db`. `.js` files will be executed by mongo using the database specified by the MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE variable in `docker-compose.yml`, if it is present, or `test` otherwise. You may also switch databases within the .js script.

### Store MongoDB data on Host System

Directory named `data_db` will serve as a MongoDB data directory on the host system (outside the container). It is easy for tools and applications on the host system to access the MongoDB files from this directory. The `data_db` directory from host system is mounted to `/data/db` inside the container, where MongoDB by default will write its data files.

### Perform database migration at the beginning

Using docker hierarchy in `docker-compose.yml`, the services `make-migration` and `migration` runs after setting up the database but before the start of the main `web` service. This docker configuration helps us to automatically run the django migration commands on the application once the database has been setup.

### Web-based MongoDB admin interface

This example also creates a web-based user inteface for MongoDB called [mongo-express](https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express) through port 8081.


## Troubleshooting/Issues

Known Issues:
#### :warning: Warning running on Windows OS
* The default Docker setup on Windows uses a VirtualBox VM to host the Docker daemon. Unfortunately, the mechanism VirtualBox uses to share folders between the host system and the Docker container is not compatible with the memory mapped files used by MongoDB. This means that it is not possible to run a MongoDB container with the data directory mapped to the host on Windows OS.
* As a quick work around to run this example on windows machine please comment few lines of volume mapping in `docker-compose.yml`.
